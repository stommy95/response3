### Microsoft Word and Markdown 
Have you ever just written in a Microsoft word document just because it is the easiest most accessible text editor for you? Of course, everyone has because Microsoft pretty much has a monopoly on the business. But, what Microsoft does not tell you a lot of people do not use the word document so when you carelessly send out a word document to a friend you are assuming they have access to the program. That means for people that do not have word must do a work-around in order just to see what was so important you needed a word document to send. Furthermore, as a person that wants to help the people it’s as simple as learning markdown to put your text online, or put the text in an email next time. You would not assume someone does a lot of drugs and then just randomly hand them a bag of narcotics, so do not live under the assumption the world uses Microsoft word. “When you make an assumption, you make an ass out of you and mption.” In second article “The reason I want Microsoft word to die is that until it does, it is UNAVOIDABLE.” For all the technology in this digital age people are constantly looking for the easiest way to do things but what most people do not know Markdown is the easiest way to do things. It is just a couple of symbols to learn and then you just write the text, it has no buttons or formats meaning its simplicity is its asset. You do not have to worry about what programs people do or do not have because if you have a computer then it can read and see Markdown. Markdown is also a great way to show text because with just “a couple of added tags and metadata it can be translated in to HTML or XHTML.” 

### Podcasting 
Another platform that created an industry itself is the podcast revolution. The podcast journey is a short one but has a curious past that has changed way information is accessed today, 2017. In 1996 is where the podcast journey began when the RSS feed was created for authors to get their content out to people. Quickly following was the audio feed within the RSS which was instituted in late 2000. However, the podcast got its big start with the public radio exchange in late 2003 establishing the first of its kind. Podcasting is very educational and is now part of the entertainment business in America and throughout the world bringing people knowledge from an audio source only.
